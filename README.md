# Score Counter web app
This is an older assignment I once got showing the use of state (MobX) and react. The syntax is weird and cumbersome I know.

## Note
Will not change or update this project due to this being a historical project.

## Instructions
Perform install of dependencies

`npm install`

then

`npm start`

It will start the service and open a browser window.
